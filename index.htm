	  For this repo, I first created a repo in github by uploading  index.htm and the 2 folders \css and \js
	  this procedure is explained in:   https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/

	  now we have a clone of the repository in github
	  by default it gets the name of "origin"

	  we can now do stuff from the command line

	  first, cd into the local repo:     cd firstrepo

	  to get the name of the remote repository:   git remote -v
	  // origin  https://github.com/xthdraft/firstrepo.git (fetch)
      // origin  https://github.com/xthdraft/firstrepo.git (push)

	  to get url of the remote repository named "origin" :    git remote get-url origin
	  // https://github.com/xthdraft/firstrepo

	  ***   PUSHING CHANGES TO THE REMOTE REPOSITORY

	  after changing file (eg index.htm) in local repo, you add it to the repo:   git add "index.htm"
	  then commit it:     git commit -m 'FIRST CHANGE'
	 
	  then push to github:   git push --set-upstream origin master
